# Bayesian-in-Python
Bayesian network implemented in python (PLay Tennis dataset)

 Bayesian networks are a type of probabilistic graphical model that uses Bayesian inference for probability computations.
 
 Here we use a predefined dataset commonly used in machine learning notes, the playtennis dataset.
 We define new instances and use probability to determine whether tennis can be played or not using MAP rule.
